Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m @EconDataScience otherwise known as Alex or Sasha (Being Russian-American makes things complicated sometimes :P) 

I love all things data science/econometrics and started this page to both archive my exisiting work in research and teaching as well as document my learning path as I continue to pick up new projects and skills.
